          	<p>In what has become something of a tradition around here, I've once again decided to redesign this site, this time with one eye toward responsivity and one toward minimalism, the latter of which constituting the most-recent decision.</p>
            <p>Some of the more substantial changes I've made include turning the site into more of a blog. Given that I've really only ever used this site to write posts and to upload videos, I think this was a good design decision. You can, of course, judge for yourself, but I think I've done quite a brilliant job, what with the fact that the entire redesign took just under one day.</p>
            <p>In addition to turning the site into more of a blog, I've adopted a less-is-more mentality and have given the site a minimalist design. I've made this decision for many reasons, one important reason being that I want this new version of the site to espouse more of a professional, clean impression. </p>
            <p>The third and final change I've made is that this site will now be exclusively a science blog, in which I'll write about all things infancy research, computational modelling, and statistics. I figure that because I'm in graduate school, my aim should be to write about the things I am learning and the things I've so far learned.</p>
            <p>N.B. I've decided for the time being to keep the dummy posts (found on the home page) until there's enough written material to replace them. I promise that I'll endeavor to work as quickly as possible to replace the dummy posts with (ideally) more interesting material. Pray, be patient!</p>

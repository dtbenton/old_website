			<p>After 2 years 1 month and 5 days of not blogging, I'm back.</p>
			
			
			<p>Rather than bore you with the minutiae of my absence, I'll just mention that since I last blogged I've moved twice, conducted many different projects with infants, children, and adults (some of which are being written up currently for publication and some of which may or may not be incorporated into my dissertation), learned a new programming language in R&mdash;including learning new and exciting statistical tools and techniques for analyzing data in that language&mdash;and have completed all required coursework and requirements for my department. Clearly, I've been busy, and everything I just briefly mentioned only begins to scratch the surface.</p>

			<p>My hope is that now that I won't be tied down by coursework and the like and now that I'm ABD (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_but_dissertation" target="_blank">"all but dissertation"</a>) , I'll have more time to blog and maybe even redesign this site a bit. In the past, I blogged about all manner of things, from the mathematics (i.e., the calculus) behind the backpropagation algorithm used in neural networks, to the importance of linear algebra in computational modeling and statistics more generally, to the development of inclusive and exclusive categories of cats and dogs in 4-month-old infants (I am a developmental psychologist, after all).</p>

			<p>Perhaps more than anything else, blogging about such diverse (and seemingly disparate) topics was a productive exercise because it forced me to engage with each of these topics (among others) at a deep and non-superficial level, which has paid enormous dividends for my research, my thinking, and my development as a researcher. My aim for my blog (and blog posts) going forward is to continue in this tradition and to write blogs about some of the more recent stuff I've learned, I've taught to others, and I'm teaching myself such as using R to develop deeper intuitions about different statistical tools and tests.</p>
			
			<p>That is about all I have in terms of updates and future plans. Stay tuned for my next update.</p>
			
			<p>Until next time,</p>
			<p>&mdash;d</p>
			
			<p>NB. I'll be adding a link on this site to my CV. I'm not sure where I'll place that link, but I'll be sure to update you where you can find it on this site when I do.</p>
